# SecureChat
###Designed and implemented a secure peer-to-peer chat applicaton in C++ utlizing DTLS 1.2 over UDP for
encrypted communicaton.
### Featuring X.509 certfcate generaton, mutual authentcaton, session resumpton, & packet loss handling. Simulated
MITM atacks to illustrate vulnerabilites by interceptng, downgrading, & tampering with communicatons using fake
certfcates and DNS/ARP poisoning
### Tech Stack: [C++, DTLS v1.2, UDP, OpenSSL, X.509 Certfcates, DNS Poisoning, ARP Cache Poisoning]
